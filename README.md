## Introduction
Welcome to the Number Plate Detection Model with IoT Integration repository! This project is designed to detect and recognize license plates in images and, optionally, integrate with Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time monitoring and alerting. Whether you're interested in security, traffic management, or any other application involving number plate recognition, this repository has you covered.

## IoT Integration

## Features
Efficient license plate detection using deep learning techniques.
License plate recognition (OCR) to extract the characters from detected plates.
Real-time processing of images or video streams.
IoT integration for sending alerts and data to connected devices.
Easy-to-use API for integration with other applications.
Detailed documentation to help you get started.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow for deep learning.
* OpenCV for image processing.
* Flask for creating a web API.
* IoT Platform for IoT integration (optional).
* Installation
* Clone the repository:


Code :- ``git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-plate-detection-iot.git``
``cd number-plate-detection-iot``
## Install the required Python packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Download the pre-trained deep learning models for license plate detection and recognition.

Set up the IoT platform (if integrating with IoT).

Usage
Run the main application:

`python main.py`
Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 to upload images or configure real-time video stream processing.

For API access, use the endpoints described in the API documentation.

## IoT Integration
This project includes optional IoT integration capabilities. By connecting it to an IoT platform, you can:

Receive alerts when specific license plates are detected.
Send data to other IoT devices for further processing.
Monitor and control the application remotely.
For detailed IoT integration instructions, check out the IoT Integration Guide.
